# SteamAuth2

**SteamAuth2** is a MediaWiki extension that allows users to sign in with Steam. This extension 
requires [PluggableAuth](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PluggableAuth) version 6.0 or above. 

This is a fork of the original [SteamAuth](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SteamAuth) extension,
which is no longer maintained.
